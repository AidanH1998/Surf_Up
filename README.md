# Surf_Up

## Overview ##

We are given an assignment that will tell us the temperture for a location that will be holding a surf store. In this deliverable we will be looking a two opposite months that will show us if having a store for surfing will be a good item, so that we can make money throughout the seasons. This investment is to show that having a surfing store will be profitable during all seasons.

The temperture is more favorable to be around 75 degrees.


December is a winter season, so the temperture is thought to be low. However the temps are only 5 degrees lower.

The range shows that the lower percentile is 69 degrees and the higher percentile is 74 degrees, so that if temps where people can still surf because the water isn't freezing.
